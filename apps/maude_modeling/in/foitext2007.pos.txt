854662|17288107|N|1||EVALUATION SUMMARY: THE DEVICE IS AN INSTALLED CENTRALIZED PT MONITORING SYSTEM WITH WIRELESS OR WIRED CONNECTIONS TO BEDSIDE MULTIFUNCTIONAL PT VITAL SIGNS MONITORS. THE ETHERNET HUB SWITCH, MODEL SUPERSTACK 1100, BY MANUFACTURER 3COM, FAILED. THE ETHERNET SWITCH IS PART OF THE NETWORK CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ACUITY CENTRAL STATION HARDWARE AND THE BEDSIDE MONITORS. WHEN THE SWITCH COMPONENT FAILS, CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ACUITY STATION AND THE BEDSIDE MONITORS CONNECTED TO THE SWITCH IS LOST. IN THIS CASE THERE WERE 2 MONITORED PATIENTS CONNECTED THROUGH WIRED NETWORK CONNECTIONS THROUGH THE SWITCH AND 2 MORE PATIENTS ON WIRELESS TELEMETRY CONNECTIONS WHERE THE CONNECTION WAS LOST AND CENTRAL STATION MONITORING WAS COMPROMISED UNTIL A REPLACEMENT SWITCH WAS INSTALLED. HOSPITAL STAFF RESPONDED BY MONITORING PATIENTS AT BEDSIDE. THERE WAS NO PATIENT HARM ASSOCIATED WITH THE FAILURE. THE SYSTEM WAS INSTALLED IN JULY, 2001. HOSPITAL EQUIPMENT SUPPORT STAFF REPORTED THAT THERE HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTION NEAR THIS SWITCH. THE STAFF MEMBER REPORTED THAT STAFF HAD WRAPPED THE SWITCH IN PLASTIC WRAP TO AVOID DEBRIS CONTAMINATING THE SWITCH. HE REPORTED THAT NONETHELESS THE SWITCH HAD SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CONCRETE DUST INSIDE IT AFTERWARDS. HE VOLUNTEERED THAT THE CONCRETE DUST, AND THE LACK OF VENTILATION WHILE THE SWITCH WAS WRAPPED IN PLASTIC, MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE OF THE SWITCH. WE CONTACTED THE SWITCH MANUFACTURE, 3COM CORPORATION, AND WE WERE INFORMED BY THEIR TECH SUPPORT STAFF THAT THIS MODEL OF SWITCH WAS OBSOLETE AND NO LONGER SUPPORTED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT ABLE TO OFFER FAILURE INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE ROOT CAUSE, THEREFORE, THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE IS INDETERMINATE. NOTE THAT THE ACTUAL DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED TO WELCH ALLYN, BUT WE ASSISTED THE COMPLAINANT AND THEIR SUPPORT PERSONNEL IN TROUBLE SHOOTING AND THAT WAS SUFFICIENT TO CONFIRM THE REPORTED DEFECT. THE FAILED SWITCH WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER, BUT ONLY FOR VERIFICATION OF THE FAULT FOR WARRANTY PURPOSES. THE NURSE MANAGER AT THE HOSPITAL, DECLINED TO PROVIDE PATIENT INFORMATION ON THE 4 PATIENTS CONNECTED TO THE SYSTEM AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE. SHE REPORTED THAT THE MANAGEMENT AT THE HOSPITAL SITE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY RULES UNDER REGULATIONS.

822082|19327965|N|1||SOFTWARE BEHAVIOR WAS ANALYZED AND INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED A SOFTWARE ANOMALY. THE ANOMALY OCCURS  WHEN USING REFERENCE CT IMAGES WITH NON-UNIFORM SLICE SPACING (E.G., 5 MM AT THE ENDS OF THE SCAN AND 2.5 MM IN THE MIDDLE). IF NON UNIFORM SLICE SPACING IS USED, THE ON-BOARD IMAGING SOFTWARE WOULD DISPLAY THE SLICES WITH AN EQUAL INTERVAL, WITHOUT CALCULATING SLICES TO ALLOW FOR THE DIFFERENT SLICE THICKNESS. THIS LED TO A SKEWED 3D VOLUME IN THE LONGITUDINAL DIRECTION (Z-AXIS). THE AMOUNT OF SKEWING DEPENDED ON THE VARIANCE BETWEEN SLICE THICKNESSES. INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THIS ISSUE WAS THAT IT WAS NOT LIKELY TO LEAD TO DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY AS THE PROBABILITY OF HARM WAS DEEMED TO BE IMPROBABLE. THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTS OF ACTUAL PATIENT MISTREATMENTS DUE TO THIS ISSUE. SUBSEQUENT TO THIS ASSESSMENT, A MEDICAL DEVICE CORRECTION WAS IMPLEMENTED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE FOR ALL AFFECTED CUSTOMERS. DUE TO THE DECISION TO PERFORM A DEVICE CORRECTION, VARIAN HAS DETERMINED THAT AN MDR IS APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.

843998|598975|D|1||CENTRALIZED PT MONITORING WAS LOST FOR APPROX ONE HR BECAUSE ONE OF THEIR TERMINAL SERVERS (TS), TS-4, HAD FAILED AND DUE TO ENSUING ERRORS. TERMINAL SERVERS ARE A COMPONENT OF THE NETWORK CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ACUITY CENTRAL STATION CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU) AND THE BEDSIDE MONITORS. IF A TERMINAL SERVER FAILS, THE ACUITY CPU CANNOT CONTACT OR RECEIVE DATA FROM THE BEDSIDE MONITORS. MONITORING AND ALARM FUNCTIONS AT THE BEDSIDE MONITOR IS UNAFFECTED. THERE WERE MULTIPLE PTS CONNECTED AND CENTRALLY MONITORED ON BOTH SYSTEMS AT THE TIME CENTRALIZED MONITORING WAS LOST, BUT THERE WAS NO PT HARM THAT RESULTED.
843998|7871605|N|1||MFR'S EVAL SUMMARY: THE DEVICE IS AN INSTALLED CENTRALIZED PT MONITORING SYSTEM THAT UTILIZES A SUN SPARCSTATION 5-170 CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU). THE DEVICE RECEIVES, ANALYZES AND DISPLAYS PT VITAL SIGNS DATA FROM MULTIPLE BEDSIDE MULTIFUNCTIONAL PT MONITORING DEVICES THROUGH EITHER WIRED OR WIRELESS CONNECTIONS. CENTRALIZED PT MONITORING WAS LOST FOR APPROX ONE HR BECAUSE ONE OF THEIR TERMINAL SERVERS (TS), TS-4, HAD FAILED AND DUE TO ENSUING ERRORS. TERMINAL SERVERS ARE A COMPONENT OF THE NETWORK CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ACUITY CENTRAL STATION CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU) AND THE BEDSIDE MONITORS. IF A TERMINAL SERVER FAILS, THE ACUITY CPU CANNOT CONTACT OR RECEIVE DATA FROM THE BEDSIDE MONITORS. MONITORING AND ALARM FUNCTIONS AT THE BEDSIDE MONITOR ARE UNAFFECTED. TS-4 SERVES ACUITY. THE CUSTOMER MISTAKENLY ASSUMED THAT THE SPARE TS THAT THEY HAD COULD BE SWITCHED IN WITHOUT ANY CONFIGURATION. UNFORTUNATELY, THE SPARE TS HAD BEEN CONFIGURED TO REPLACE TS-3, ANOTHER TERMINAL SERVER SERVING ANOTHER ACUITY UNIT. THE RESULT WAS THAT THERE WERE THEN TWO TERMINAL SERVERS CONFIGURED WITH THE SAME NETWORK ADDRESS, CAUSING NETWORK ERRORS AND FURTHER LOSS OF CENTRALIZED MONITORING ON THE OTHER ACUITY SYSTEM. THE CUSTOMER CONTACTED WELCH ALLYN TECHNICAL SUPPORT, WHO ASSISTED THE CUSTOMER IN RE-CONFIGURING THE SPARE TS TO THE PROPER NETWORK ADDRESS AND THEN HELPED THE CUSTOMER TO RESTORE NORMAL OPERATION ON BOTH ACUITY SYSTEMS THAT HAD LOST CENTRALIZED MONITORING. THERE WERE MULTIPLE PTS CONNECTED AND CENTRALLY MONITORED ON BOTH SYSTEMS AT THE TIME CENTRALIZED MONITORING WAS LOST, BUT THERE WAS NO PT HARM THAT RESULTED FROM THIS EVENT. BY EVENT HERE AND IN THE CODES OF FORM 3500, WE MEAN THE LOSS OF CENTRALIZED MONITORING. THE TS THAT FAILED WAS A NORTEL. IT WAS SHIPPED TO THE CUSTOMER AS PART OF SYSTEM IN 12/1999. THE DEVICE IS NO LONGER PRODUCED OR SUPPORTED BY ITS MFR, SO FAILURE INVESTIGATION IS NOT POSSIBLE.

857912|17421818|D|1||THE CUSTOMER CONTACT REPORTED AN ADVERSE EVENT WHILE THE DEVICE WAS IN USE. IN 2007 AT 1800, THE DEVICE WAS PROGRAMMED TO DELIVER "DILAUDID 300MG/30ML" WITH A 1MG PCA DOSE, A 6 MINUTE PATIENT LOCKOUT, AND AN 8MG 4 HOUR LIMIT. THE PROGRAMMING WAS REPORTEDLY VERIFIED BY FOUR STAFF MEMBERS AND THE DELIVERY WAS STARTED. THE FOLLOWING DAY AT 0630, THE NURSE NOTED THE PATIENT WAS "TALKING, FINE, ORIENTED." AT 0715, A TECHNICIAN ENTERED THE ROOM AND FOUND THE PATIENT "BARELY BREATHING & NOT RESPONSIVE". THE CODE TEAM WAS INITIATED. THE PATIENT'S OXYGEN SATURATION WAS LOW, "BUT HE WAS BREATHING AND NEVER LOST HIS BLOOD PRESSURE OR PULSE." THE DEVICE WAS REMOVED FROM CLINICAL SERVICE. THE PATIENT WAS TREATED WITH NARCAN 0.4MG. THE CUSTOMER CONTACT STATED THE PATIENT, "CAME RIGHT OUT OF IT AND WAS TRANSFERRED TO ICU. THERE WERE NO REPORTED ADVERSE PATIENT SEQUELAE. AFTER AN UNSPECIFIED LENGTH OF TIME, IT WAS NOTED THAT THERE "WAS ONLY 19ML LEFT IN THE VIAL, BUT THERE WAS A PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR". THE CUSTOMER CONTACT REPORTED THAT MORE MEDICATION WAS EXPECTED TO BE REMAINING IN THE VIAL; HOWEVER, IT WAS UNSPECIFIED WHETHER THE PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR WAS FROM THE MEDICATION VIAL OR AN UNSPECIFIED IV FLUID. A REVIEW OF THE PATIENT RECORD BY THE CUSTOMER CONTACT INDICATED THAT THE "PATIENT TOOK AT LEAST 6 DOSES OF MEDICATION" BETWEEN 1800 AND 0630. THE CUSTOMER CONTACT STATED "UNFORTUNATELY, THE WAY IT WAS CHARTED, THERE IS NO WAY TO COME TO A CONCLUSION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PATIENT. IT IS AN ASSUMPTION THAT HE GOT TOO MUCH MEDICATION." THE CUSTOMER CONTACT REPORTED THERE WAS NO DEVICE MALFUNCTION OR PROGRAMMING ERROR NOTED. THOUGH REQUESTED, NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED.

CHECK THE AUTOCRANE CLAMPS AND PRESS 'NEXT' TO TRY AGAIN." THERE WAS A SOFTWARE ISSUE WHERE THE SYSTEM WOULD ERRONEOUSLY EXPECT THE AUTOCRANE CLAMPS TO BE TIGHTENED WITHOUT THE AUTOCRANE POSITION BEING CHANGED. IF THE AUTOCRANE WAS MOVED CLOSER TO OR FURTHER AWAY FROM THE COUCH DURING THE PROCESS OF CLAMPING IT TO THE ACCESSORY RAIL, THE PT POSITION FOR THAT TREATMENT SESSION WOULD BE INCORRECT BY THE DISTANCE THAT THE AUTOCRANE WAS MOVED.

WE OBSERVED SIMILAR FAILURES, AT A LOW RATE OF OCCURRENCE AND HAVE CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE. THIS WAS ATTRIBUTED TO A COMPONENT FAILURE, WHICH CAN CAUSE THE REED SWITCH TO STICK FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO A MAGNETIC FIELD. AS A RESULT, PROCESS CHANGES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO CORRECT THE ISSUE AND IMPROVE THE RELIABILITY OF THE REED SWITCH FUNCTIONALITY. IT IS SUSPECTED THAT NO TONES WERE HEARD FROM THE DEVICE DUE TO A FIRMWARE ISSUE RELATED TO THE PLACEMENT OF A MAGNET OVER THE DEVICE BETWEEN R-WAVES OF TWO SEQUENTIAL CARDIAC CYCLES. THIS ISSUE IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION. NO ADVERSE PATIENT EFFECTS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED AND THE DEVICE REMAINS IMPLANTED. THE DEVICE WAS EXPLANTED SIX YEARS LATER FOR REPORTED NORMAL BATTERY DEPLETION AND RETURNED FOR STANDARD ANALYSIS TESTING. UPON RECEIPT AT OUR POST MARKET QUALITY ASSURANCE LABORATORY, ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THAT THE REED SWITCH WAS STUCK, WHICH CAUSED THE ERRONEOUS PROGRAMMER MESSAGE THAT THERE IS A MAGNET PRESENT THAT WAS OBSERVED CLINICALLY. BOSTON SCIENTIFIC HAS OBSERVED SIMILAR DEVICE BEHAVIOR AND HAS CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE. OUR INVESTIGATION HAS DETERMINED THAT THIS BEHAVIOR IS ATTRIBUTED TO A COMPONENT ISSUE, WHICH CAN CAUSE THE REED SWITCH TO STICK FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO A MAGNETIC FIELD. AS A RESULT, PROCESS CHANGES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO CORRECT THE ISSUE AND IMPROVE THE RELIABILITY OF THE REED SWITCH FUNCTIONALITY AND AN ADVISORY WAS COMMUNICATED WORLDWIDE IN 2010.

854581|7958071|N|1||THIS ISSUE DOES NOT AFFECT QC SINCE CYTOSETTINGS ARE NOT IMPORTED. PER THE TSR, DURING A NORMAL WORKFLOW, A CLINICIAN PLACES THE INSTRUMENT IN A "SET-UP" MODE TO ADJUST SETTINGS BEFORE RUNNING PATIENT SAMPLES. ONCE THE PROPER SETTINGS ARE DONE, THE INSTRUMENT WOULD BE PLACED IN A NORMAL RUN MODE AND THE SOFTWARE WOULD AUTOMATICALLY RESET BEFORE RUNNING PATIENT SAMPLES. THIS EFFECT WOULD THEREFORE NOT BE SEEN ONCE SAMPLES RUNS HAVE BEGUN AS NO FURTHER CHANGES TO THE CYTOSETTINGS WOULD BE MADE. THIS ISSUE DOES NOT AFFECT LOCKED PROTOCOLS AS STEM OR TETRA. HOWEVER, IT COULD AFFECT ANY UNLOCKED APPLICATIONS AS LEUKOSURE APPLICATION PROTOCOLS WHERE THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR ERRONEOUS RESULTS TO BE PRODUCED. THIS ISSUE WAS FOUND TO AFFECT ALSO THE CURRENT MXP VERSION 2.1 SOFTWARE. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WAS DETERMINED TO BE A SOFTWARE DEFECT WHICH WILL BE CORRECTED IN THE UPCOMING VERSION.
854581|614885|D|1||WHILE CONDUCTING AN IN-HOUSE TESTING ON THE UPCOMING MXP SOFTWARE VERSION 2.2, BECKMAN COULTER INC. (BCI) TECHNICAL SUPPORT REP (TSR) DISCOVERED A SOFTWARE ISSUE: WHEN ACQUIRING DATA FROM A PROTOCOL, AN OPERATOR CAN CHOOSE TO GET/IMPORT CYTOSETTINGS FROM ANOTHER LIST MODE FILE. IF THE ALREADY DISPLAYED DATA IS NOT REFRESHED AS IT SHOULD, THIS CAUSES THE INSTRUMENT TO OUTPUT RESULTS, WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM A COMBINATION OF THE TWO CYTOSETTINGS RATHER THAN THE NEWLY IMPORTED SETTINGS AS IT SHOULD. THE HISTOGRAMS AND PRINTOUTS RESULTS ARE GENERATED FROM BOTH, AN OLD AND THE NEW CYTOSETTINGS. THIS DATA IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF EITHER CYTOSETTINGS, BUT RATHER A COMBINATION OF THE TWO AND IS THEREFORE, ERRONEOUS. A PRINTOUT OF THE RUN WILL SHOW THE CUMULATIVE DATA AND ERRONEOUSLY IMPLY THAT THE NEWLY IMPORTED CYTOSETTINGS PRODUCED IT. FURTHER REVIEW OF THIS PROBLEM BY TSR INDICATES THAT THE SAVED RUNTIME DATA (LIST MODE FILE) WILL ALSO CONTAIN THIS CUMULATIVE DATA AS WELL. THE TSR INDICATED THAT PATIENT RESULTS WERE NOT AFFECTED IN THIS EVENT SINCE IT OCCURRED DURING AN INTERNAL TESTING, AND NO PATIENT RESULTS WERE RELEASED AT THE TIME. THERE WAS NO AFFECT TO PATIENT OR USER RELATED TO THIS EVENT.

822040|8055725|N|1||ON 1/22/2007, INVESTIGATION REVEALED AN ALGORITHM CALCULATION ERROR ONLY IN IMSURE QA SOFTWARE V3.0, AS PREVIOUS VERSIONS DID NOT INCLUDE ELECTRON CALCULATIONS. THE ERROR INCREASES AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEPTH AND DEPTH (MAX) INCREASES. IF THEY ARE EQUAL, THERE IS NO ERROR. HIGHER ELECTRON ENERGIES WILL HAVE A GREATER ERROR. ABSOLUTE WORST CASE ERROR IS UP TO 12% IN RARE AND EXTREME INSTANCES, BUT COMMON ERRORS WILL BE IN THE 1 TO 5% RANGE. ERRORS GREATER THAN 10% MAY BE SIGNIFICANT, AND THUS THE REASON FOR THE CONSERVATIVE FILING OF THIS FDA FORM 3500A. INVESTIGATION DEMONSTRATED THAT USER MANUAL INSTRUCTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS ADDRESS THIS TYPE OF ISSUE. SHIPMENT OF IMSURE QA SOFTWARE V3.0 WAS DISCOUNTED ON 01/22/2007. A NEW VERSION WAS ALREADY PLANNED FOR RELEASE IN 02/2007, SO THIS VERSION (V3.0.1) WAS UPDATED TO INCLUDE THE REQUIRED ELECTRON ALGORITHM CORRECTION.

954172|8007667|N|1||INVESTIGATION SUMMARY: IN 2007 THE CUSTOMER REPORTED INTERMITTENT SAMPLING ERRORS ON A CELL-DYN 3200 ON PT TESTING. PATIENTS ARE RUN IN CLOSED MODE. CONTROLS ARE RUN IN OPEN MODE AND WERE WITHIN ASSAY RANGE. DURING THE SAMPLING ERROR ISSUE OF EVENT DATE, A PT RESULT WAS REPORTED OUT AND QUESTIONED BY THE PHYSICIAN. ON THAT DAY, THE SAMPLE HAD HGB=6.0 G/DL. THE SAMPLE WAS RETESTED ON THE CD 3200 AND OFFSITE RESPECTFULLY OBTAINING RESULTS OF HGB=11.2/12.0 G/DL. CUSTOMER REPEATED SAMPLE ON 3/13 WITH HGB=11.3 G/DL. THERE WAS NO TREATMENT TO THE PT OR DELAY OF TREATMENT. NO ADDITIONAL INFO ON THE PT WAS AVAILABLE. TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED BY CUSTOMER, WITHOUT RESOLUTION. THE CUSTOMER REPLACED TRANSFER PUMP TUBING, CLEANED SHEAR VALVE AND REPLACED DILUENT/SHEATH. THE CUSTOMER TECHNICAL ADVOCATE (CTA) INSTRUCTED THE CUSTOMER TO ASPIRATE A SAMPLE THEN OBSERVE SAMPLE MOVEMENT IN THE PATHWAY UP TO AND THROUGH THE SHEAR VALVE AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE SHEAR VALVE. THE CTA RECOMMENDED ADDITIONAL TROUBLESHOOTING OF CLEANING Y VALVE (CUSTOMER WAS UNCERTAIN IF ISSUE IS IN CLOSED AS WELL AS OPEN MODE) AND CLEANING THE CLOSED MODE ASPIRATION NEEDLE. ABOUT SIX DAYS LATER, THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THE ISSUE PERSISTED. A FIELD SERICE REP (FSR) WENT TO SITE THAT DAY. THE FSR CLEANED AND CLEARED PARTICLES FROM DILUTION PATH, THEN CLEANED/ADJUSTED VOLTAGE ON HGB FLOW CELL, CLEANED THE WOC FLOW CELL AND REMOVED CLOTS FROM SAMPLE INJECTION TUBING. ON THE FOLLOWING DAY, THE VERIFICATION OF THE INSTRUMENT WAS DONE BY RUNNING CONTROLS WHICH PASSED.

933823|708434|D|1||AN IN-HOUSE INVESTIGATION REVEALED AN ISSUE WITH THE ACCELERATOR APS/IOM SYSTEM. WHEN A SAMPLE PRESENTATION/SAMPLE QUEUE ERROR IS GENERATED, THE APS CAN ERRONEOUSLY GENERATE A "PREPARE TO RUN" MESSAGE FOR THE FIRST SAMPLE TUBE. THE SYSTEM HAS ALREADY RECEIVED A "SAMPLE COMPLETE" MESSAGE, SO THE QUERY FOR PREPARE TO RUN COMES BACK NEGATIVE. WHEN THE SAMPLE IS PRESENTED BACK TO THE ANALYZER TO BE RUN AS THE OPERATOR IS INSTRUCTED TO DO, THE APS DOES NOT SEND THE "PREPARE TO RUN" MESSAGE TO THE ANALYZER BECAUSE, THE MESSAGE WAS ALREADY SENT INAPPROPRIATELY. WITHOUT THE "PREPARE TO RUN" MESSAGE, THE ANALYZER DOES NOT QUERY THE LIS AND RE-RUN ORDERS ARE NOT DOWNLOADED. THE ANALYZER GENERATES A LIS ERROR AND SENDS A "COMPLETED WITH ERROR" MESSAGE TO THE APS. THE SAMPLE TUBE IS ROUTED BACK TO THE PRIORITY OUTPUT TRACK (ERROR TRACK) AND THE RECOVERY ATTEMPT FAILED. THE OPERATOR WILL BE ABLE TO RE-RUN THE SAMPLE IF THEY AGAIN REORDER THE SAMPLE. THIS ERROR HAS NO IMPACT ON PATIENT IDENTIFICATION OR ERRORS OF PIPETTING. THE ISSUE IS ONE OF AN EXTRA "PREPARE TO RUN" MESSAGE THAT ONLY IMPACTS THE INSTRUCTIONS THE OPERATOR IS GIVEN TO RECOVER FROM THE SAMPLE PRESENTATION/SAMPLE QUEUE ERRORS AND PRESENTS NO IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT.

881666|622151|D|1||DIABETIC USING MEDTRONIC MINIMED PARADIGM 722 INSULIN PUMP WITH REALTIME SENSOR. IN USE SINCE 2007. FIRST SET OF 10 SENSORS WORKED FLAWLESSLY. STARTED NEW SET LOT # E317 -DATE CODE: APPROX SEVEN MONTHS LATER- AND HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS. HAVE CALLED MEDTRONIC ABOUT THIS PROBLEM 4 TIMES. VARIATIONS BETWEEN SENSOR AND ACTUAL METER READING OF MORE THAN 100 IS TYPICAL. THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR ANY MEDICAL DEVICE. THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA AND I AM WONDERING WHAT KIND OF CHECKS ARE IN PLACE. THIS LAST BATCH OF SENSORS I SUSPECT, HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO HIGH -ABOVE 120 DEG.- TEMPERATURES -ON A SLOW SHIP FROM CHINA??- AND ARE BAD. CALLED MEDTRONIC AGAIN TONIGHT,  AND THEY SAID TO STOP USING THEM AND TO SHIP THEM BACK. THEY WILL SHIP REPLACEMENTS, BUT ARE BACKORDERED. WAS SUPPOSED TO GET 4 REPLACEMENTS FROM A CALL MADE 06/29/07, BUT THESE HAVE NOT BEEN SHIPPED YET -BACKORDERED??-. WAS ON A MEDTRONIC 508 PUMP FOR 4 YEARS, SO I AM NOT NEW TO PUMP THERAPY. THOUGHT THE REALTIME SENSOR WOULD GIVE ME BETTER CONTROL. DID LOWER MY HB1AC TO 7.0 WITH THE FIRST BOX OF SENSORS, BUT NOW I DON'T TRUST THEM. MEDTRONIC HAS A CARELINK WEB SITE TO ENTER DATA FROM THE PUMP/SENSOR/METER ON A REGULAR BASIS. THIS SITE -OR THE PUMP- HAS A SOFTWARE ERROR, WHICH I HAVE ALSO REPORTED. SHOWS ALL BG ENTRIES AS METER READINGS WHEN IN FACT THEY MAY NOT BE. USING THE BOLUS WIZARD SEQUENCE CALLS FOR THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION TO BE ENTERED IN THIS ORDER: BG, RECORD IN METER -Y/N-, CARBS, GIVES A RECOMMENDED AMOUNT OF BOLUS, WHICH CAN BE INCREASED OR DECREASED. EACH STEP REQUIRES THE PRESS OF THE ACT BUTTON TO ACCEPT THE ENTRY. WHEN A BG IS ENTERED -ACT KEY PRESSED- IT IS RECORDED AS A METER BG, WHICH MAY NOT BE THE CASE. THE DATA SHOULD BE RECORDED AFTER THE NEXT STEP RECORD IN METER -Y/N-. A NO HERE -1 BYTE- WOULD INDICATE DISREGARD THIS NUMBER. THE SITE IS HTTPS://CARELINK.MINIMED.COM/PATIENT/ENTRY.JSP?BHCP, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CHECK THIS OUT. I METER TEST MORNING, DINNER AND BEDTIME -3 TIMES A DAY NORMALLY- WITH THE SENSOR. DATES OF USE: SIXTEEN DAYS IN 2007. DIAGNOSIS OR REASON FOR USE: DIABETES WITH LARGE BG SWINGS. EVENT REAPPEARED AFTER REINTRODUCTION? YES. NOT REPROCESSED, BUT CAN BE USED FOR 2-3 DAY CYCLES.

822022|19736871|N|1||ON 01/22/2007, INVESTIGATION REVEALED AN ALGORITHM CALCULATION ERROR ONLY IN IMSURE QA SOFTWARE V3.0, AS PREVIOUS VERSIONS DID NOT INCLUDE ELECTRON CALCULATIONS. THE ERRORS INCREASES AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEPTH AND DEPTH (MAX) INCREASES. IF THEY ARE EQUAL, THERE IS NO ERROR. HIGHER ELECTRON ENERGIES WILL HAVE A GREATER ERROR. ABSOLUTE WORST CASE ERROR IS UP TO 12% IN RARE AND EXTREME INSTANCES, BUT COMMON ERRORS WILL BE IN THE 1 TO 5% RANGE. ERRORS GREATER THAN 10% MAY BE SIGNIFICANT, AND THUS THE REASON FOR THE CONSERVATIVE FILING OF THIS FDA FORM 3500A. INVESTIGATION DEMONSTRATED THAT USER MANUAL INSTRUCTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS ADDRESS THIS TYPE OF ISSUE. SHIPMENT OF IMSURE QA SOFTWARE V3.0 WAS DISCONTINUED ON 01/22/2007. A NEW VERSION WAS ALREADY PLANNED FOR RELEASE IN EARLY 02/2007, SO THIS VERSION (V3.0.1) WAS UPDATED TO INCLUDE THE REQUIRED ELECTRON ALGORITHM CORRECTION. IT WILL BE PROVIDED TO ALL IMSURE V3.0 USERS, AS WAS PREVIOUSLY PLANNED. ADD' MODEL # 91326, 91328.

959108|7896516|N|1||THIS ISSUE WAS CONFIRMED BY THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS, APPLIED CYTOMETRY SYSTEMS (ACS/OEM MFR). THIS ONLY AFFECTS EXTERNAL WORKLIST (EWL) FILES CREATED ON THE CELL PREP SYSTEM AND OPENED ON THE CXP ACQUISITION SOFTWARE VERSION 2.2. WORKLISTS OR INDIVIDUAL PANELS OPENED IN CXP ACQUISITION MANAGER DO NOT EXHIBIT THIS PROBLEM. WHENEVER SAMPLE ID1 IS EDITED FOR TUBE 1 IN A PANEL, OR A PANEL IN A WORKLIST, THE REMAINING TUBES IN THE PANEL ARE AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED TO MATCH THE EDITED SAMPLE ID1 AND ALL TUBES IN THE PANEL HAVE THE SAME SAMPLE ID1. BASED ON INVESTIGATION, THE FOLLOWING FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED TO HELP THE OPERATOR IN IDENTIFYING THE ISSUE: THE SAMPLE ID1 FIELD OF THE SUBSEQUENT TUBES NOT UPDATED WILL BE VISIBLE TO THE OPERATOR WHEN THE FIRST TUBE IS EDITED. THE OPERATOR IS CAUTIONED BY THE CUSTOMER MANUAL TO "BE SURE TO VERIFY ANY MANUALLY ENTERED SAMPLE IDS." (CXP ONLINE HELP). THE USER IS ALSO CAUTIONED AT SEVERAL POINTS IN THE USER DOCUMENTATION TO "VERIFY ALL SAMPLE IDS BEFORE REPORTING RESULTS". IF THE OPERATOR PRINTS A FLOWPAGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL RUNS THAT CONSTITUTED THE PANEL, EACH PAGE, TAKEN ON ITS OWN COULD SERVE AS A SOURCE OF PT MIS-IDENTIFICATION. AS A PART OF REGULAR QC, THE RESULTS MUST BE COMPARED BETWEEN THE PRINT-OUTS OF THE PANEL. IN ADDITION, THE SOFTWARE USES THE RUN NUMBER AND THE ANALYSIS TIME AS UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS AND COULD BE USED TO RESOLVE ANY POTENTIAL CONFUSION. BASED ON WORK CONDUCTED BY ACS, THE SOURCE OF THE ERROR WAS DETERMINED TO BE A SOFTWARE DEFECT.

IF THIS OCCURS, THE SPLINE MATH MODEL CANNOT DISTINGUISH WHICH SEGMENT OF THE CALIBRATION CURVE IS THE CORRECT SEGMENT TO CALCULATE THE RESULT. IN THESE CASES, THE SPLINE MATH MODEL WILL USE A LOWER SEGMENT OF THE CALIBRATION CURVE TO DETERMINE THE RESULT. WHEN THE ISSUE OCCURS, A FALSELY DECREASED RESULT MAY BE GENERATED. A NEGATIVE RESULT CAN BE GENERATED FOR NON-ABBOTT ASSAYS WITH NO CONFIGURED LINEARITY PARAMETER. THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT REPORTED.

ONE POTENTIAL CAUSE OF A LOSS OF REFERENCE VOLTAGE IS A TRANSIENT FAILURE OF THE PENDANT CABLE, WHICH COULD THEN RESULT IN UNWANTED DRIVE COMMANDS WHEN THE MEB'S ARE ENABLED. A CORRECTION TO THIS ANOMALY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THAT WILL EFFECTIVELY PREVENT FURTHER OCCURRENCES OF UNWANTED CLINAC MOTIONS DUE TO PENDANT FIRMWARE FAILURES. VARIAN'S ORIGINAL RISK ASSESSMENT DETERMINED THAT, DUE TO MULTIPLE MITIGATING FACTORS, SUCH AS RELEASE OF THE MEB'S OR THE CLOSE AVAILABILITY OF EMERGENCY OFF BUTTONS, IF THE INCIDENT WERE TO RECUR, IT WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.

914419|19516682|N|1||THE INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY FIELD SERVICE ENGINEERING CONCLUDED THAT THE SYSTEM ERROR EXPERIENCED BY THE CUSTOMER WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEFT MASTER TOOL MANIPULATOR (MTML). THE SYSTEM WAS REPAIRED BY REPLACING THE AFFECTED MTML. THE SYSTEM ALARM (THE 23008 SYSTEM ERROR CODE) FUNCTIONED AS DESIGNED AND THERE WAS NO INJURY TO THE PATIENT. THE 23008 SYSTEM ERROR CODE APPEARS WHEN THE DA VINCI S SAFETY SYSTEMS DETERMINED THAT THE ANGULAR POSITION OF ONE OR MORE ROBOTIC JOINTS ON THE SPECIFIED MANIPULATOR, AS MEASURED BY THAT JOINT'S PRIMARY CONTROL SENSOR (ENCODER) AND THE SECONDARY SENSOR (POTENTIOMETER), WERE OUT OF SPECIFIED TOLERANCE FOR AGREEMENT. UPON DETERMINING, THIS CONDITION, THE SAFETY SYSTEMS PUT DA VINCI S IN A "RECOVERABLE SAFE STATE". THIS CHECK MAY RESULT FROM A FAILED ENCODER, THE FAILED POTENTIOMETER, A BROKEN LINK OR MOMENTARY IMPACT ON THE ARM BY A CUSTOMER (E.G., BUMPING THE ARM). THE MTML WAS RETURNED TO ISI FOR FAILURE ANALYSIS INVESTIGATION. ENGINEERING DISCOVERED A DEFECTIVE POTENTIOMETER ASSEMBLY WITHIN THE MTML, THUS GENERATING THE SYSTEM ERROR EXPERIENCED BY THE CUSTOMER. AS OF SEPTEMBER 13, 2007, THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTED RECURRENCES OF THE ISSUE AT THIS HOSPITAL.

LIMITED LOGS WERE SENT AND IN SPITE OF MULTIPLE REQUESTS TO RISK MANAGEMENT AND BIOMED, ADDITIONAL LOGS WERE NOT SENT. REPORTED THE SYRINGE RAN DRY BETWEEN 1:40 PM AND 2:30 PM. THE CHILD WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE ICU FOR OBSERVATION. NO OTHER MEDICAL INTERVENTION WAS REPORTED. LOG REVIEW SHOWED THE USER SELECTED CUSTOM CONCENTRATION (_MG/_ML) RATHER THAN STANDARD MORPHINE CONCENTRATION AND RECEIVED A CLINICAL ADVISORY STATING 2 RNS SHOULD REVIEW SETTING BEFORE STARTING INFUSION. USER CONFIRMED THE ADVISORY THEN ENTERED THE DRUG AMOUNT 1.5 MG AND DILUENT VOLUME 55 MLS. THIS RESULTED IN A CONCENTRATION OF 0.027 MG/ML. THE USER WAS THEN PRESENTED WITH THE PROGRAMMED AND RESTORED PARAMETERS AS FOLLOWS: PCA DOSE = 1.5 MG, LOCKOUT = (DATASET DEFAULT 5 MINUTES), CONT. DOSE = 1.5 MG/H. THE USER SELECTED "CONFIRM" AND SUBSEQUENTLY PRESSED "START" AT 13:40. NOTE: GIVEN THE NEW CONCENTRATION OF 0.027 MG/ML AND THE RESTORED PARAMETERS FROM THE PREVIOUS INFUSION, THE CONTINUOUS DOSAGE OF 1.5 MG/H RESULTED IN A CONTINUOUS FLOW RATE OF 54.945 ML/HR, WHICH RESULTED IN NEARLY THE ENTIRE SYRINGE BEING DELIVERED OVER 50 MINUTES. REVIEW OF THE LIMITED LOG INDICATES THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE OVERINFUSION OF MORPHINE WAS THE RESULT OF A PROGRAMMING ERROR WHEN ENTERING THE CUSTOM CONCENTRATION OF THE SYRINGE. THE USER ACCEPTED THE CLINICAL ADVISORY AND ACCEPTED THE PROGRAMMED SETTING AND SUBSEQUENTLY STARTED THE INFUSION. THE USER PROGRAMMED A SYRINGE CONCENTRATION OF 0.027 MG/ML. THIS CONCENTRATION DIFFERS FROM THE REPORTED SYRINGE CONCENTRATION OF 1MG IN 1ML.

912737|20116698|N|1||THE SCOPE OF THIS ISSUE IS LIMITED TO INSTRUMENT MANAGER VERSIONS. ALSO, ONLY CUSTOMERS USING THE SPECIMEN MANAGEMENT FEATURE COULD POTENTIALLY BE AFFECTED. RESEARCH OF OUR PAST CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS AND OUR FIELD HISTORY SHOWS THAT DATABASE ISSUES OCCUR VERY INFREQUENTLY. AND, DETAILED CODE-REVIEW SHOWS THAT THE ONLY REASONABLE CAUSE FOR THE IDENTIFIED APPLICATION INTEGRITY PROBLEMS ARE DUE TO A SYSTEMS DATABASE FILE FILLING AT THE PRECISE INSTANT A RESULT WAS BEING FILED IN THE DATABASE. THIS WOULD CAUSE AN INCOMPLETE RECORD OF THE DATA. HOWEVER, BECAUSE DI IS UNABLE TO DETERMINE A ROOT CAUSE OF THE ISSUE AT THIS TIME, ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN TO ASSIST POTENTIALLY AFFECTED CUSTOMERS. ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN: DATA INNOVATIONS WILL NOTIFY ALL POTENTIALLY AFFECTED CUSTOMERS, ALERTING THEM THAT THERE MAY BE APPLICATION INTEGRITY ISSUES WITH CERTAIN VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE. DI WILL DISTRIBUTE A UTILITY THAT WILL CHECK THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA, CORRECT ANY CORRUPTIONS, AND PROVIDE USERS WITH A REPORT. DI WILL ALSO UPDATE RELEVANT PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION TO ENSURE CUSTOMERS KNOW THE RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES FOR CHECKING APPLICATION INTEGRITY WHEN CACHE STOPS DUE TO AN ABNORMAL EVENT, SUCH AS A DATABASE/DRIVE FILLING OR A POWER OUTAGE. NOTE: THE SUPPLIED TOOL WOULD ONLY BE FOR THE SOFTWARE VERSIONS IDENTIFIED. THIS IS NOT NECESSARY FOR V8.05 AND LATER. EVALUATION SUMMARY: THE SITE REPORTING THIS ISSUE TO DATA INNOVATIONS DISCOVERED IT AS LAB STAFF CHECKED RESULTS IN THEIR LABORATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM, AND SO NO HARM WAS CAUSED TO ANY PATIENT OR USER RELATED TO THE MIS-REPORTED DATA THAT WAS REPORTED BY THE SITE. ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION WILL EVALUATED OTHER AFFECTED SPECIMENS TO VERIFY THAT NO HARM WAS CAUSED TO ANY PATIENT OR USER AS A RESULT OF ADDITIONAL MIS-ASSOCIATION OF DATA THAT IS UNK TO US AT THIS TIME. THE INSTRUMENT MANAGER SOFTWARE WAS NOT RETURNED TO DATA INNOVATIONS, BUT DI STAFF HAS EVALUATED DATA RETURNED TO US BY THE SITE REPORTING THE ISSUE. SPECIFICALLY, AUDIT TRAIL AND SPECIMEN EVENT LOG INFORMATION WAS GATHERED AND REVIEWED. REVIEW OF THIS INFORMATION ASSISTED IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE PROBLEM AS REPORTED BY THE SITE. AFTER DETAILED CODE-REVIEW, THE ONLY REASONABLE CAUSES FOR THE IDENTIFIED APPLICATION INTEGRITY PROBLEMS ARE DUE TO CACHE STOPPING DUE TO AN ABNORMAL EVENT, SUCH AS A SYSTEMS DATABASE/DRIVE FILING OR A POWER OUTAGE AT THE PRECISE INSTANT A SPECIMEN IS FILED IN THE DATABASE. THESE CONDITIONS COULD CAUSE AN INCOMPLETE RECORD OF THE DATA. HOWEVER, AT THIS POINT IN THE INVESTIGATION, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM AT DATA INNOVATIONS. FOR THIS REASON A CONCLUSIVE ROOT CAUSE OF THE DATABASE CORRUPTION HAS YET TO BE DETERMINED. DI STAFF WAS ABLE TO CORRECT THE CORRUPTED DATABASE AND CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THE REPORTING SITE'S DATA ON A WEEKLY BASIS TO VERIFY THAT THIS CORRECTION IS EFFECTIVE.

921541|8129949|N|1||NO MEDWATCH WAS GENERATED AT THE TIME THE COMPLAINT WAS OPENED IN 2006, SINCE THE CUSTOMER'S REPORT WAS CONSIDERED A CLEANING ISSUE AND IT APPEARED THAT THEY WERE NOT ALLOWING THE TELEPACK TO DRY AFTER CLEANING. DURING INVESTIGATION RELATED TO A CURRENT FIELD CORRECTION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THIS COMPLAINT MAY BE RELATED TO THE FIELD CORRECTION AND A MEDWATCH IS REQUIRED. THE EXACT INCIDENT DATE(S) ARE NOT KNOW. DATASCOPE IDENTIFIED A SOFTWARE ANOMALY THAT AFFECTS THE PANORAMA TELEPACK. IF AN ECG CABLE, WHICH HAS BEEN DAMAGED DUE TO THE INGRESS OF LIQUID OR BY MECHANICAL TRAUMA, IS UTILIZED WITH A TELEPACK, IT MAY CAUSE THE TELEPACK TO RAPIDLY SWITCH BETWEEN THE 3-LEAD AND 5-LEAD INPUT MODES. DURING THE SWITCHING PROCESS, THE DIGITAL HEART RATE DISPLAYED AT THE PANORAMA WILL BE FROZEN, AND SUBSEQUENT ARRHYTHMIA ALARMS WILL NOT BE ANNOUNCED. THIS SCENARIO WILL OCCUR ONLY IF ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS EXIST: A DAMAGED ECG CABLE IS UTILIZED AND, A 5-LEAD CABLE IS BEING USED AND THE RL LEAD IS DISCONNECTED FROM THE PATIENT. THE ANOMALY CAN BE CORRECTED BY ATTACHING THE RL LEAD TO THE PATIENT, OR REMOVING THE DAMAGED ECG CABLE AND REPLACING IT WITH A NEW ONCE. THIS SCENARIO WILL NOT BE IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS TO THE CLINICIAN VIEWING THE DATA AT THE CENTRAL STATION. IN THE EVENT THAT THIS ANOMALY WAS TO PRESENT, THE POTENTIAL RISK TO THE PATIENT IS LARGELY BASED UPON THE DEACTIVATION OF THE ARRHYTHMIA ALARMS. THE LACK OF AN ALARM MAY LEAD TO A DELAY IN DIAGNOSIS AND ULTIMATELY DELAY TREATMENT. DATASCOPE HAS INITIATED A VOLUNTARY FIELD CORRECTION TO ADDRESS THIS ANOMALY. THE CUSTOMER WILL RECEIVE NEW SOFTWARE THAT ADDRESSES THIS ANOMALY AS PART OF THE FIELD CORRECTION. THE FDA DISTRICT OFFICE IS BEING NOTIFIED. A CORRECTION REPORTING NUMBER HAS NOT YET BEEN ASSIGNED.

893025|7808851|N|1||METHOD: WELCH ALLYN TECHNICAL SUPPORT ANALYZED THE LOG FILES TO CONFIRM SYSTEM REBOOT. EVAL SUMMARY: THE DEVICE IS AN INSTALLED CENTRALIZED PATIENT MONITORING SYSTEM THAT UTILIZES A SUNBLADE 1500 CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU). THIS CUSTOMER HAS A HIGH AVAILABILITY (HA) PAIR, WHICH IS A PAIR OF CPUS RUNNING IN PARALLEL TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF THE LOSS OF CENTRALIZED MONITORING. IF ONE SYSTEM GOES DOWN, THE SECOND SYSTEM IS THERE TO TAKE UP THE CENTRALIZED MONITORING LOAD. IN THIS PARTICULAR EPISODE, SYSTEM A, WHICH IS THE PRIMARY UNIT IN THE HA PAIR, REBOOTED DURING A TERMINAL SERVER REPLACEMENT AND CONFIGURATION EFFORT. NORMALLY, REBOOTING ONE SYSTEM WILL NOT CAUSE THE BACKUP SYSTEM TO REBOOT AS WELL. IN THIS CASE, IT DID RESULTING IN A TEMPORARY LOSS OF CENTRALIZED MONITORING. WELCH ALLYN TECH SUPPORT ASSISTED THE CUSTOMER IN RESTORING NORMAL OPERATION. ALTHOUGH THE ACUITY SYSTEM WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR CENTRALIZED MONITORING WHILE THE SYSTEM WAS REBOOTING, PATIENT VITAL SIGNS MONITORING CONTINUED AT BESIDE WITH THE LOCAL BEDSIDE PATIENT MONITOR FOR ANY PATIENTS CONNECTED TO THE SYSTEM. THERE WERE NO PATIENTS HARMED IN ANY WAY BY THE EVENT. BY EVENT HERE AND IN THE CODES FORM 3500, WE MEAN THE LOSS OF CENTRALIZED MONITORING. EVALUATION OF THE SYSTEM LOGS FOLLOWING THE RESTORATION OF NORMAL OPERATION INDICATED THAT THE PRIMARY SYSTEM HAD BEEN SET UP TO CONTROL CERTAIN MEMORY OPERATIONS FOR THE PRIMARY AND HA BACKUP SYSTEM. WHEN THE PRIMARY SYSTEM WAS REBOOTED AS A RESULT OF THE TERMINAL SERVER FAILURE, THOSE MEMORY OPERATIONS FAILED ON THE HA BACKUP, CAUSING IT TO HANG AND BECOME UNAVAILABLE. FINALLY, WE ARE SENDING THIS REPORT IN MORE THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE BECOME AWARE DATE. WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT THAT THIS REPORT WAS A DUPLICATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF A LOSS OF CENTRALIZED MONITORING REPORTED PREVIOUSLY ON MDR # 3023750-2006-176. FURTHER INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT, ALTHOUGH THE SYMPTOMS WERE SIMILAR AND THE DATES WERE NEARLY THE SAME, THE TWO REPORTS WERE NOT THE SAME.

903995|682857|D|1||A CUSTOMER CONTACTED BAXTER TECHNICAL SERVICE REGARDING A POSSIBLE OVERFILL DURING FILL 1 OF THERAPY USING THE HOMECHOICE SYSTEM. THE HOME PATIENT (HP) FELT ABDOMINAL CRAMPING/PAIN AND VOMITED AND WANTED TO END THERAPY. THE INITIAL DRAIN VOLUME WAS 0ML. THE TECHNICAL SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (TSR) ASSISTED THE HP TO MANUALLY DRAIN APPROXIMATELY 300ML. THE FILL VOLUME THEN SHOWED-23ML. THE HP STATED THEY FELT RELIEVED. THE HP INFORMED THE TSR OF A COLONOSCOPY (3 IN ONE WEEK) THAT HAD OCCURRED EARLIER IN THE DAY. THE HP THOUGHT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PART OF THE CAUSE FOR ABDOMINAL PAIN. THE HP WAS UNSURE IF HE HAD DRAINED OUT MANUALLY DURING THE DAY OR IF THERE WAS SOLUTION IN THE PERITONEUM THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THE HP'S LAST FILL VOLUME WAS 2000ML. THE HP DID NOT KNOW THE PROGRAM PARAMETERS OF THE HOMECHOICE. THE HP DID NOT KNOW IF THERE WAS A POTENTIAL PROGRAMMING ERROR, BUT THE HP HAD ALREADY CONTACTED THE NURSE TO SEE HER IN THE MORNING. THE HP DID NOT RECALL SPECIFICS OF THE INCIDENT, INCLUDING THE ULTRAFILTRATION RATE. THE HP WAS NOT TREATED FOR THE OVERFILL SITUATION. THE DEVICE WAS NOT POWERED DOWN WHEN THIS OCCURRED, AS THERAPY WAS ENDED AND IT OCCURRED DURING FILL 1. THE HP SUSPECTED HE HAD TOO MUCH SOLUTION, HOWEVER, DID NOT KNOW HOW OR WHY. NO ALARMS OR CYCLES WERE BYPASSED. THE HP ENDED THERAPY THAT NIGHT AND PERFORMED THERAPY THE NEXT NIGHT AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE. AFTER MEETING WITH THE NURSE, PER THE HP, THE THERAPY SETTINGS HAVE NOT BEEN RE-EVALUATED. THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES TO THE HP'S MEDICATIONS/DIET. THE OVERFILL WAS NOT RECOGNIZED BY THE HP'S CLINIC. THE HP IS FEELING FINE, THERE WAS NO PATIENT INJURY OR MEDICAL INTERVENTION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT. THE HP REPORTED HIS THERAPY HAS BEEN GOING GREAT SINCE THE INCIDENT. CAUSE WAS NOT IDENTIFIED, HOWEVER, THE HP FEELS THE COLONOSCOPY MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ABDOMINAL PAIN.

917889|691225|D|1||REVISED - ORIGINAL 3500 FORM SUBMITTED ON 09/19/07. RESUBMITTED DUE TO COMPUTER PROGRAMMING ERROR. DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT WHICH OCCURRED WITH THE DATASCOPE PANORAMA CENTRAL CARDIA MONITOR STATION ON TEN DAYS EARLIER AT HOSP. AN INTENSIVE CARE PT WITH A PHYSICIAN ORDER FOR DNR/CCA -DO NOT RESUSCITATE COMFORT CARE- ARREST- WAS PLACED ON A BEDSIDE CARDIAC MONITOR CALLED THE DATASCOPE SPECTRUM. THE PT WAS FOUND DECEASED WITHIN MINUTES OF A BEDSIDE VISUAL CHECK AND MULTIPLE VISUAL REVIEWS OF HIS CARDIAC RHYTHM AT THE CENTRAL STATION MONITOR. UPON REVIEW OF THIS EVENT, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE VOLUME ALARM CONTROL FOR THE EXTERNAL SPEAKER ON THE CENTRAL MONITOR IN THE NURSES' STATION WAS TURNED DOWN TO A VERY LOW VOLUME SETTING MAKING THE ALARM INAUDIBLE AT THE CENTRAL STATION CARDIAC MONITOR. IT WAS ALSO NOTED THAT THE BEDSIDE CARDIAC MONITOR WAS SILENCED FOR THE COMFORT OF THE PT AND HIS FAMILY--AN ACCEPTABLE CLINICAL PRACTICE DEPENDING ON THE PATIENT'S NEEDS AND CONDITION. SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS TAKEN: ON THE SAME DAY-- HOSPITAL'S BIOMEDICAL ENGINEER IMMEDIATELY REMOVED THE BEDSIDE MONITOR FROM SERVICE AND LOCKED IT IN A SAFE PLACE UNTIL THE FOLLOWING MORNING. ON THE NEXT DAY--REPRESENTATIVES FROM DATASCOPE, HOSP, AND ARAMARK DOWNLOADED THE PT'S HISTORY, ALL EVENT ALARMS, AND ALL EVENT CARDIAC RHYTHM STRIPS FOR QA PURPOSES; EXTERNAL VOLUME CONTROL AT THE CENTRAL CARDIAC MONITOR STATION WAS "TAPED" TO PREVENT MOVEMENT AND TO ENSURE ALARMS REMAINED AUDIBLE. ON THE FOLLOWING DAY--A MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED; REPRESENTATIVES FROM DATASCOPE, ARAMARK, AND HOSP RE-INSTATED THE USE OF THIS BEDSIDE MONITOR AFTER MAKING SURE ALL OF THE LETHAL ALARMS WERE AUDIBLE BOTH IN THE PT ROOMS AND AT THE CENTRAL CARDIAC MONITOR STATION; EXTERNAL VOLUME CONTROL ON THE CENTRAL CARDIAC STATION WAS "SET AND IMMOBILIZED" BY BIOMEDICAL; ALL STAFF WERE CONTACTED AND INFORMED THAT THE VOLUME CONTROL WAS SECURED AND TO MAKE SURE THE EXTERNAL SPEAKER'S GREEN LIGHT WAS ON; ATTEMPTED TO REPLACE EXTERNAL SPEAKER WITH TWO OTHER SPEAKERS WITH NO EXTERNAL VOLUME CONTROL BUT THESE WERE INCOMPATIBLE WITH CENTRAL STATION. ON 09/13/07--DATASCOPE WORKING UP QUOTE FOR THE PURCHASE OF A NEW CENTRAL CARDIAC MONITOR STATION WITH INTERNAL SPEAKERS AND INTERNAL CONTROLS. -PER DATASCOPE REPRESENTATIVE ON 09/09/07, THIS DATASCOPE PANORAMA MODEL IS NO LONGER BEING SOLD. IT WAS ALSO DISCUSSED THAT GREENE MEMORIAL HOSP WAS NEVER ALERTED THAT THIS MODEL WAS DISCONTINUED SINCE OUR PURCHASE AND INSTALL IN 02/06 AND HOSP WAS NOT ALERTED TO THE POTENTIAL SAFETY DESIGN FLAW WITH THE EXTERNAL VOLUME CONTROL ON THE CENTRAL CARDIAC STATION MONITOR BEING EASILY ADJUSTABLE-. ON FIVE DAYS PRIOR TO ORIGINAL DATE--DISABLED EXTERNAL ON/OFF SWITCH AT CENTRAL STATION. ON ONE DAY PRIOR TO ORIGINAL DATE--REPRESENTATIVES FROM GREENE MEMORIAL AND DATASCOPE CONTINUE TO DISCUSS PLANS FOR STAFF EDUCATION. DATES OF USE: 2007.

THE FRONT BEZEL WAS OPENED & A VISUAL INSPECTION OF ALL WIRES, HARNESS CONNECTIONS, AND USER INTERFACE MODULE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD WAS PERFORMED. THE MASTER AND SLAVE SOFTWARE PROGRAMMABLE READ ONLY MEMORY WERE FOUND INSERTED CORRECTLY. NO VISUAL DAMAGE WAS FOUND. THE BATTERIES HAD 10 CHARGE/DISCHARGE CYCLES & 0 DISCHARGES BELOW ALARM THRESHOLD. THE PUMP PASSED THE KEYPAD TEST. THE DEVICE HAS BEEN RETURNED TO BAXTER TECHNICAL SERVICE FOR REPAIR. THE BUFFER OVERFLOW ISSUE RESULTING IN FAILURE CODE 16:310 FOUND IN THE SOFTWARE VERSION UTILIZED IN COLLEAGUE INFUSION PUMPS HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE REPEATABLE IN A SPECIFIC CLINICAL SITUATION, AND HAS RESULTED IN MULTIPLE PATIENT ADVERSE EVENTS OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME FOLLOWING INITIATION OF DEPLOYMENT OF THIS SOFTWARE VERSION IN THE US. THE ISSUE IS CAUSED BY AN OVERFLOW IN THE MEMORY BUFFER THAT FEEDS THE MAIN PROCESSOR. THE C2006 SOFTWARE VERSION INCLUDES SEVERAL CHANGES THAT HAVE INCREASE THE UTILIZATION LEVEL OF THIS BUFFER, RESULTING IN A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF OVERFLOW. FOR THE VERSION OF SOFTWARE UTILIZED IN PUMPS OUTSIDE OF THE US (VB), INCLUDING THE ONE INVOLVED IN THIS COMPLAINT FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY,  THE BUFFER UTILIZATION LEVEL IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER. THE COMPLAINT RATE FOR THE VB SOFTWARE IS APPROXIMATELY 1 COMPLAINT PER MILLION INFUSIONS (CPMI) AS COMPARED TO A COMPLAINT RATE OF 163 CPMI ON THE C2006 SOFTWARE. BASED ON THESE DIFFERENCES, COLLEAGUE INFUSION PUMPS WITH THE VB SOFTWARE ARE NOT CONSIDERED EQUIVALENT TO THOSE WITH THE C2006 SOFTWARE.

946614|737901|D|1||HOSPIRA DISTRIBUTES A COMPUTER PROGRAM ENTITLED "HOSPIRA LIFECARE PCA LABEL UTILITY VERSION 1.0" FOR USE WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HOSPIRA LIFECARE PCA PUMP; THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW ENTRY OF EACH DRUG CONCENTRATION INTO A FORMULATION LIBRARY ON A PHARMACY COMPUTER, AND IS USED FOR STANDARDIZED PRINTING OF BARCODED LABELS. DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE AT MY HOSP, WE NOTICED SEVERAL ERRORS CAUSED BY THE SOFTWARE. DURING AND AFTER THE EDITING PHASE, THE SOFTWARE HAS REPEATEDLY MOVED DECIMAL PLACES ON CONCENTRATIONS -E.G., 50 MG/DL BECOMES 5 MG/DL, OR 1 MG/ML BECOMES 10 MG/DL-; AND CHANGED CONCENTRATION UNITS -MG/ML TO MCG/ML AND VICE VERSA-. ALTHOUGH I CAN'T CONFIRM THAT THE SOFTWARE CHANGES BARCODE INFO AS WELL, OUR SISTER HOSPITAL HAS REPORTED THAT ERROR IN ADDITION TO THE CONCENTRATION CHANGES MENTIONED ABOVE. WHEN FORMULATIONS ARE OPENED FOR EDITING, REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO CORRECT AND SAVE THE INFO OFTEN FAIL -THE LIBRARY WON'T UPDATE THE CORRECTED INFO-. I HAVE EXPERIENCED THESE SOFTWARE ERRORS ON THREE SEPARATE COMPUTERS IN OUR PHARMACY DEPT -TWO WITH WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL, ONE WITH WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL OPERATING SYSTEMS-. ESPECIALLY CONCERNING IS THAT THESE ERRORS OCCURRED DURING LABEL PRINTING, WHEN THE LIBRARY ENTRIES ARE SUPPOSEDLY CLOSED FOR EDITING. I WAS ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATE THESE ISSUES TO HOSPIRA REPRESENTATIVES ON 11/01/2007 AND AGAIN ON 11/06/2007. WE WERE UNABLE TO DETERMINE A SEQUENCE OF PROGRAM COMMANDS THAT MIGHT DUPLICATE THE ERRORS; IT IS COMPLETELY SPORADIC. AS A RESULT WE HAVE HAD TO HALT ALL PHARMACIST PRINTING OF LABELS FOR PCA SYRINGES UNTIL ADEQUATE SOFTWARE IS OBTAINED. NAME: HOSPIRA LIFECARE PCA LABEL UTILITY V. 1.0 DATES OF USE: 2007. FOR OTHER HOSPITALS, DATES OF USE UNKNOWN.

THE PACKAGE RETURNED TO MEDTRONIC WAS NOT SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE MANUFACTURING ANALYSIS LAB FROM THE USER FACILITY, AS REQUESTED. THE PACKAGE WAS FIRST SENT TO MEDTRONIC MOUNDSVIEW DISTRIBUTION PRODUCT CENTER WHERE THE LABEL/PAPERWORK MAY HAVE BEEN INADVERTENTLY DISCARDED DURING PROCESSING. FINDINGS FROM SUBSEQUENT PACKAGE INSPECTION AFTER RETURN TO THE ANALYSIS LAB COULD NOT CONFIRM THE PACKAGING PROBLEM. NO PHOTOGRAPHS WERE OBTAINED OF THE LABEL/PAPERWORK PRIOR TO RETURN; IT IS UNKNOWN IF IT MATCHES PRODUCTION FORMS. REVIEW OF MANUFACTURING TRACEABILITY RECORDS FOUND THE LABEL DID MATCH PRODUCTION HISTORY THAT SHOWS THE DEVICE WAS SENT TO PRODUCT REVIEW BOARD (PRB) PRIOR TO DISTRIBUTION BECAUSE IT HAD NOT PASSED THE POST STERILIZATION TEST ON 08/2006. SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION DETERMINED A COMMUNICATION PROBLEM DURING PRODUCT INTERROGATION CAUSED THE FAILED TEST RESULT. DURING PRB ACTIVITIES, THE DEVICE WAS FOUND TO MEET FUNCTIONAL TESTS. THE DEVICE COMPLETED ADDITIONAL TESTING DURING MANUFACTURING AND WAS SHIPPED. REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD SHOWS THE DEVICE MET ALL MANUFACTURING SPECIFICATIONS FOR PRODUCT RELEASED TO DISTRIBUTION. THE SUMMARY OF INVESTIGATION SHOWS IT CANNOT BE DETERMINED HOW THE PAPERWORK/LABEL STATING DEVICE FAILED TESTING WAS PACKAGED AND SHIPPED WITH THE PRODUCT.

903326|703106|D|1||RECEIVED A CALL FROM BIOMED THAT HE HAD A REPORT THAT A DEVICE WAS INVOLVED IN A POSSIBLE PROGRAMMING ISSUE, AND HE WANTED SOME INFORMATION ON HOW TO TELL ON A DEVICE DISPLAY IF LIMITS WERE REACHED. KEYBOUNCE IS NOT SUSPECTED, DEVICE SERIAL NUMBER IS NOT KNOWN AS IT WAS NOT NOTED BY THE USER, AND DEVICE WAS NOT SENT TO BIOMED, IT WAS PUT BACK INTO GENERAL USE. ALL OF THE CUSTOMER'S DEVICES HAVE HAD THE SOFTWARE UPGRADE. CUSTOMER DOES NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS A DEVICE PROBLEM, THEY FEEL SURE THE ISSUE WAS USER PROGRAMMING BUT WANTED INFORMATION ON WHAT THE USER WOULD SEE IF A GUARDRAILS LIMIT WAS REACHED, AND WHAT THE DIFFERENCE WAS BETWEEN HARD AND SOFT LIMITS. THE INTENDED PROGRAMMING WAS 2.9 ML/HR, SECOND NURSE FOUND INFUSION RUNNING AT 150 ML/HR. I SUBSEQUENTLY SPOKE WITH RISK MANAGER WHO REPORTED THAT INFUSION ONLY RAN AT THIS RATE FOR 5 MINUTES OR LESS UNTIL IT WAS FOUND BY THE SECOND NURSE, AND THAT THERE WERE NO NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE PATIENT; HOWEVER, THE PATIENT WAS MORE CLOSELY MONITORED FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS AND ADDITIONAL FINGERSTICK BLOOD SUGARS WERE PERFORMED TO OBSERVE FOR HYPOGLYCEMIA; NO CONCENTRATED DEXTROSE WAS ADMINISTERED. CUSTOMER UNDERSTOOD THAT BECAUSE THE DEVICE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR INVESTIGATION WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DETERMINE ROOT CAUSE OF THE EVENT. I DID DISCUSS WITH HER THE POSSIBILITIES THAT THE USER MAY HAVE SELECTED THE WRONG CHANNEL SINCE THIS IS A DUAL CHANNEL DEVICE, OR THAT THE USER MAY HAVE ELECTED TO OVERRIDE A GUARDRAILS WARNING THAT THE PROGRAMMING EXCEEDED THEIR LIMITS. IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THERE WAS A GUARDRAILS ALERT; IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT THE SECOND NURSE WAS THE ONE WHO NOTED THE HIGH RATE AND KNEW THE INSULIN WAS PROGRAMMED IN GUARDRAILS, HOWEVER, CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THERE WAS SOME INDICATION THAT NOBODY OBSERVED ANY "UP ARROWS" ON THE DISPLAY, WHICH LEAD THEM TO BELIEVE THAT THE INCIDENT MAY HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF SELECTING THE WRONG CHANNEL. AT THEIR REQUEST CUSTOMER WAS PROVIDED WITH ADDITIONAL TRAINING MATERIALS INCLUDING COMPUTER BASED TRAINING CD'S, TRAINING MANUALS, AND QUICK REFERENCE GUIDES FOR NEW USERS.

921543|7854241|N|1||DATASCOPE IDENTIFIED A SOFTWARE ANOMALY THAT AFFECTS THE PANORAMA TELEPACK. IF AN ECG CABLE, WHICH HAS BEEN DAMAGED DUE TO THE INGRESS OF LIQUID OR BY MECHANICAL TRAUMA, IS UTILIZED WITH THE TELEPACK, IT MAY CAUSE THE TELEPACK TO RAPIDLY SWITCH BETWEEN THE 3-LEAD AND 5-LEAD INPUT MODES. DURING THE SWITCHING PROCESS, THE DIGITAL HEART RATE DISPLAYED AT THE PANORAMA WILL BE FROZEN, AND SUBSEQUENT ARRHYTHMIA ALARMS WILL NOT BE ANNOUNCED. THIS SCENARIO WILL OCCUR ONLY IF ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS EXIST. A DAMAGED ECG CABLE IS UTILIZED AND, A 5-LEAD CABLE IS BEING USED AND, THE RL LEAD IS DISCONNECTED FROM THE PATIENT. THE ANOMALY CAN BE CORRECTED BY ATTACHING THE RL LEAD TO THE PATIENT, OR REMOVING THE DAMAGED ECG CABLE AND REPLACING IT WITH A NEW ONE. THIS SCENARIO WIL NOT BE IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS TO THE CLINICIAN VIEWING THE DATA AT THE CENTRAL STATION. IN THE EVENT THAT THIS ANOMALY WAS TO PRESENT, THE POTENTIAL RISK TO THE PATIENT IS LARGELY BASED UPON THE DEACTIVATION OF THE ARRHYTHMIA ALARMS. THE LACK OF AN ALARM MAY LEAD TO A DELAY IN DIAGNOSIS AND ULTIMATELY DELAY TREATMENT. DATASCOPE HAS INITIATED A VOLUNTARY FIELD CORRECTION TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THE CUSTOMER WILL RECEIVE NEW SOFTWARE THAT ADDRESSES THIS ANOMALY AS PART OF THE FIELD CORRECTION. THE FDA DISTRICT OFFICE IS BEING NOTIFIED.

836233|22118002|N|1||ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE CONFORMAL RADIATION THERAPY PROTOCOL APPLIED TO TUMORS OF THE PROSTATE WAS MODIFIED IN VARIAN'S CADPLAN TREATMENT PLANNING APPLICATION IN MID 2004. THE USER'S INTENT WAS TO CHANGE FROM USING STATIC WEDGES TO DYNAMIC WEDGES. THIS CHANGE REQUIRED CHANGING PARAMETERS WITH THE APPLICATION IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE PROPER CALCULATION OF RADIATION INTENSITY. HOWEVER, THESE PARAMETERS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SET CORRECTLY FOR CERTAIN PATIENTS BY THE USER, AND SUBSEQUENT QUALITY ASSURANCE REVIEW (IF ANY) BY OTHER SITE PERSONNEL DID NOT DETECT THIS DISCREPANCY. AS A RESULT, 23 PATIENTS RECEIVED RADIATION TREATMENT IN EXCESS OF THEIR PRESCRIBED DOSES. THE REPORT CONCLUDED THAT THE ACCIDENT RESULTED FROM A LACK OF AWARENESS OF, OR OVERLOOKING, THE BASIC RULES OF QUALITY ASSURANCE IN RADIOTHERAPY (TRACEABILITY OF PRACTICES, DOSAGE VALIDATION, AND VERIFICATION OF ADEQUATE TRAINING OF PERSONNEL) BY THE USER FACILITY. THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTS BY USERS, WITHIN THE REPORT OR OTHERWISE, THAT THE CADPLAN TREATMENT PLANNING SOFTWARE MALFUNCTIONED IN ANY MANNER. REQUESTED THAT VARIAN CONTACT THE TWO RADIOTHERAPY CENTERS WHO ARE USING CADPLAN TREATMENT PLANNING SOFTWARE TO REMIND THEM OF THE IMPORTANCE OF QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES IN RADIOTHERAPY AND IN THE SELECTION OF STATIC AND DYNAMIC WEDGES, AS WELL AS VERIFICATION PRIOR TO USE. THIS COMMUNICATION WAS SENT IN OCTOBER, 2006. VARIAN WILL FORWARD SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE.

883335|678515|D|1||THE NOMOSSTAT SOFTWARE PERFORMS A CHECK TO VERIFY THAT THE USER HAS PROPERLY ATTACHED THE AUTOCRANE CLAMPS TO THE COUCH RAILS ONCE THE "SETUP COMPLETE" BUTTON IS PRESSED. IN THE EVENT THAT THE CLAMPS WERE NOT SECURELY ATTACHED TO THE ACCESSORY RAIL PRIOR TO THE USER PRESSING THE "SETUP COMPLETE" BUTTON, THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE WOULD BE DISPLAYED: "THE AUTOCRANE IS NOT PROPERLY CLAMPED TO THE COUCH. CHECK THE AUTOCRANE CLAMPS AND PRESS 'NEXT' TO TRY AGAIN." THERE WAS A SOFTWARE ISSUE WHERE THE SYSTEM WOULD ERRONEOUSLY EXPECT THE AUTOCRANE CLAMPS TO BE TIGHTENED WITHOUT THE AUTOCRANE POSITION BEING CHANGED. IF THE AUTOCRANE WAS MOVED CLOSER TO OR FURTHER AWAY FROM THE COUCH DURING THE PROCESS OF CLAMPING IT TO THE ACCESSORY RAIL, THE PT POSITION FOR THAT TREATMENT SESSION WOULD BE INCORRECT BY THE DISTANCE THAT THE AUTOCRANE WAS MOVED. A SITE PHYSICIST REPORTED THAT WHEN USING THE NOMOSSTAT SYSTEM THE ERROR INDICATING THAT THE AUTOCRANE WAS NOT PROPERLY CLAMPED TO THE COUCH WAS OBSERVED.

968068|7900469|N|1||THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FAULTS E233 AND E239 WAS (IN ORDER OF SEQUENCE) WAS THE WIRE BEING PULLED OUT OF THE EYE SAFETY FILTER CONNECTOR ON THE BACK OF THE LASER WHICH DISABLED THE ESF. THE WIRE THAT WAS PULLED OUT OF THE ESF BY THE STAFF WAS REPAIRED BY CLINICAL ENGINEERING AND HAS BEEN VERIFIED AS GOOD REPAIR BY LUMENIS AND A "STRAIN RELIEF" HAS BEEN ADDED AS A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE WIRE BEING PULLED OUT CAUSED THE COMPUTER FAILURE SINCE A LOGIC CHIP WAS WORKING INCORRECTLY ON THE COMPUTER BOARD FOLLOWING THE WIRE EVENT CAUSING THE E233 AND E239 TO BE DISPLAYED. THE COMPUTER BOARD WAS REPLACED. THE LAST FACTOR THAT CAUSED ERROR CODES E233 AND E239 WAS THE EYE TEAM BROUGHT THE OLDER NOVUS 2000 LASER INTO THE ROOM AND TRIED TO USE IT WITH THE EYE SAFETY FILTER AND ACCESSORIES FROM THE NEWER NOVUS 2000E. THAT PROBLEM HAS BEEN REMEDIED BY THE COLOR-CODING SYS THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY CLINICAL ENGINEERING AT THE HOSP. DEVICE PASSED OPERATIONAL SAFETY CHECKS.

EVALUATION CONFIRMED THE STATED PROBLEM OF AN INABILITY TO TURN THE DEVICE ON. INVESTIGATION FOUND SMALL PLASTIC SHAVINGS IN THE BATTERY CONTACT AREA THAT MAY HAVE INTERFERED WITH PROPER ELECTRICAL CONTACT. A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE SERVICE HISTORY FOR THIS DEVICE FAMILY (MODEL AED20) FOUND ONLY FOUR PRIOR SIMILAR INSTANCES: ONE OCCURRING IN 2004, TWO INSTANCES IN 2005 AND ONE IN 2006. THE PRESENT COMPLAINT IS THE SECOND DOCUMENTED INSTANCE IN 2006 YEAR-TO-DATE. THE LOW INCIDENCE OF THE ISSUE NOTWITHSTANDING, A DESIGN CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE BATTERY CONTACT AREA TO KEEP THE BATTERY FROM SCRAPING ALONG THE BATTERY CASE DURING BATTERY INSERTION, WHICH COULD GENERATE PLASTIC SHAVINGS THAT MIGHT INTERFERE WITH ELECTRICAL CONTACT. DURING EVALUATION, A "DEFIB COMM FAIL" ERROR WAS OBSERVED IN THE DEVICE'S INTERNAL EVENT LOG. THE CAUSE OF THIS ERROR WAS ISOLATED TO AN INTERMITTENT CONNECTION BETWEEN AN IC (INTEGRATED CIRCUIT) ITS SOCKET ON DEFIB CIRCUIT CARD. THE DEFIB ASSEMBLY WAS REPLACED TO CORRECT THIS ISSUE. AFTER ROUTINE UPDATES AND MAINTENANCE, THE DEVICE WAS FULLY TESTED AND PASSED ALL PERFORMANCE AND RELEASE TESTING.

THE NIDEK SERVICE TEAM WAS NOT COMPETENT TO DIAGNOSE AND RECOVER THE SOFTWARE PROBLEM. THIS IS REGARDING THE NIDEK 3DX DIGITAL CAMERA. SINCE I HAVE PURCHASED THE CAMERA, THE MACHINE HAD NUMEROUS PROBLEMS. FIRST, ONE OF THE SHUTTERS DID NOT COME DOWN SO THAT ONE OF THE TWO STEREO IMAGES ONLY HAD HALF OF THE IMAGE. IT ALSO HAD MANY DUST PARTICLES. "IT MONTH" TO MORE THAN HALF THE YEAR. THERE WAS ALSO SOME OTHER ISSUES OF THE CAMERA INCLUDING A BLACK DOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAMERA. THE COMPANY HIRED AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT WHO IS A PHD OF A MEDICAL SCHOOL. HE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL PROBLEMS AND RECOMMENDED A TOTAL REPLACEMENT OF THE CAMERA. THE PHD MADE A WRITTEN REPORT WHICH YOU MAY REQUEST A COPY. AFTER THE REPORT, IT DRAGGED ANOTHER HALF YEAR BEFORE I GOT THE CAMERA REPLACED IN 2006. IMMEDIATELY WITH THE REPLACEMENT, I SAW SOME DUST PARTICLE ON THE CAMERA ALREADY DURING THE INSTALLATION. THE NIDEK DID NOT GIVE ME A FULL YEAR WARRANTY FOR THE REPLACEMENT. VERBALLY, I WAS TOLD 30 DAYS. DURING THIS TIME, THE CONTACT PERSON NEVER RETURNED MY CALL. AFTER THE 30 DAYS, I FINALLY GOT HOLD OF HIM. HE TOLD ME THAT NOW YOU DO NOT HAVE WARRANTY.

948175|7894699|N|1||THE SYSTEM WAS IN A PRIMARY MODE OF OPERATION WHEN THE MISMATCH OCCURRED. THE CUSTOMER WAS ADVISED TO REBOOT THE SYSTEM, BUT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT FIXED. A FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) WAS DISPATCHED TO THE CUSTOMER'S LAB: THE FSE FOUND MULTIPLE PRINTER ERRORS WHICH STARTED THIS MORNING. PER CUSTOMER, THEY BELIEVED THEY WERE BACKING THE DATABASE UP TO A FLOPPY NIGHTLY, BUT ACTUALLY THEY WERE SAVING MANY DATABASE BACKUPS TO THE D:\BACKUP DIRECTORY. THE FSE INDICATED THAT DELETION OF THE DATABASE AND REBOOTING THE SYSTEM RESOLVED THE ISSUE. THE CUSTOMER WAS ADVISED TO FOLLOW UP THE PROCEDURE FOR DATABASE MAINTENANCE AND WAS INSTRUCTED TO DELETE DATABASE NIGHTLY. AN ADDITIONAL REVIEW OF THE EVENT LOG DATA IS INDICATIVE THAT THIS EVENT WAS A RESULT OF AN INCORRECT SHUTDOWN OF MICROSOFT SYSTEM DATABASE CAUSING AN OPERATING SYSTEM ERROR. PER PRODUCT LABELING: "THERE IS A RISK OF COMPROMISING SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY IF ARCHIVES ARE NOT PERFORMED AT THE RECOMMENDED INTERVALS. BCI RECOMMENDS THAT THE ARCHIVE FUNCTION BE PERFORMED A MINIMUM OF ONCE A MONTH. IN ADDITION, LABELING INDICATES: DO NOT LOG OUT OF THE WORKSTATION WHILE THE ANALYZER IS RUNNING A CYCLE. LOGGING OUT DURING AN ANALYZER CYCLE WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS WITH THE ANALYZER/WORKSTATION COMMUNICATION."

SO, IF THE HELMET LOCK IS JAMMED DURING LOCK/UNLOCK, OR IF THE USER DOES NOT PRESS THE LOCK /UNLOCK BUTTON LONG ENOUGH, THE HELMET LOCK CAN BE BETWEEN LOCK AND UNLOCKED, AND THEN THE USER CAN START THE LIFTING MOTION. THIS SOFTWARE BUG EXISTS IN CU S/W VERSION 2.0.4, WHICH WAS RELEASED IN THE FIRST RELEASE OF LGK C.2, AND IT ALSO INCLUDED IN THE 1.2 HARDWARE UPGRADE KIT. LATER RELEASES OF CU SOFTWARE DOES NOT HAVE THE BUG. THE USER CAN AVOID THIS ISSUE BY OBSERVING THE LED INDICATORS OF THE HELMET CHANGER HAND CONTROL, BEFORE STARTING THE LIFTING MOTION: THERE ARE LED INDICATORS ON THE HELMET CHANGER HAND CONTROL, THAT CLEARLY INDICATES IF THE HELMET LOCK IS LOCKED OR UNLOCKED OR IN BETWEEN (NO INDICATOR LIGHT). THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN: AN IMPORTANT NOTICE HAS BEEN SENT TO ALL CUSTOMERS AFFECTED BY THIS ISSUE, SOFTWARE UPGRADE TO CORRECT PROBLEM. REFER TO CORRECTION REPORT 9612186-9106-001-C.
