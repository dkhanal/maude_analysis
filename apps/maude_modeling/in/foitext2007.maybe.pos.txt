800992|15688042|D|1||REPORTER INDICATED PATIENT HAD BEEN PROGRAMMED TO 8.0MA DURING A PROGRAMMING SESSION AT A ROUTINE OFFICE VISIT. THE PROGRAMMING ANOMALY WAS NOT DISCOVERED UNTIL ONE DAY FOLLOWING OFFICE VISIT. PATIENT WAS REPROGRAMMED TO NORMAL SETTINGS AT THAT TIME. NO SERIOUS INJURY WAS REPORTED.
851663|18489179|D|1||REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE HANDHELD SCREEN BECAME FROZEN FOLLOWING AN ERROR MESSAGE UPON INITIAL USAGE OF THE HANDHELD DEVICE. BOTH HARD AND SOFT RESETS WERE PERFORMED BY THE PHYSICIAN AND THE SOFTWARE PROBLEM DID NOT RESOLVE. SEVERAL GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO FACILITATE THE RETURN OF THE PRODUCT TO CYBERONICS FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS AND HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
899955|7911839|N|1||THE INVESTIGATION DID CONFIRM THE PROBLEM. THE VALVE COULD NOT REPROGRAM. THE SERIAL NUMBER OF THE VALVE WAS FOUND, THE LOT NUMBER WAS CFJCY9 AND THE PRODUCT CODE WAS FOUND TO BE 82-3832 AND NOT 82-3162 AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BY THE CUSTOMER. THE VALVE WAS ON POSITION 30 MM H2O WHEN RECEIVED. THE VALVE WAS TESTED FOR PROGRAMMING. THE VALVE FAILED TO REPROGRAM. THE VALVE WAS THEN IRRIGATED WITH PURIFIED WATER AND IT WAS RETESTED FOR PROGRAMMING. THE VALVE SUCCEEDED TO REPROGRAM. THE VALVE WAS EXAMINED UNDER A MICROSCOPE AT APPROPRIATE MAGNIFICATION AND IT WAS DISMANTLED. A SLIGHT AMOUNT OF WHITE DEBRIS WAS NOTED ON THE BASE PLATE BUT IT COULD NOT CAUSE THE PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS NOTED. IT MIGHT BE THAT SOME BIOLOGICAL DEBRIS, WHICH INTERFERED WITH THE ABILITY OF THE VALVE TO REPROGRAM, SOFTENED AND WAS FLUSHED OUT DURING THE IRRIGATION OF THE DEVICE. HOWEVER, THIS COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED. NO OTHER POTENTIAL CAUSES FOR PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS WERE NOTED. REVIEW OF HISTORY DEVICE RECORDS CONFIRMED THE VALVE CONFORMED TO THE SPECIFICATIONS AND PASSED ALL PROGRAMMING TESTS WHEN RELEASED TO STOCK IN AUGUST 2005. THE PRESENCE OF WHITE DEBRIS APPEARED TO BE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE DEVICE FAILURE REPORTED. DEBRIS IN THE PROGRAMMING CONTROL MECHANISM CAN CAUSE THE TYPE OF PROBLEM NOTED. NO CORRECTIVE ACTION IS NEEDED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE EVALUATION. TRENDS WILL BE MONITORED FOR THIS OR SIMILAR COMPLAINTS. AT THE PRESENT TIME THIS COMPLAINT IS CLOSED.
875558|17313028|N|1||THE INVESTIGATION DID NOT CONFIRM THE PROBLEM. NO PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS WERE NOTED DURING THE EVALUATION AT THE INVESTIGATION SITE. THE SERIAL NUMBER OF THE VALVE WAS FOUND AND THE PRODUCT CODE WAS REPORTED TO BE 82-3100. A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT ON THE VALVE BEFORE BEING SENT TO THE INVESTIGATION SITE FOR EVALUATION. IT WAS NOTED THAT THE VALVE WAS OCCLUDED AND COULD NOT REPROGRAM AS EXPECTED. AFTER THE DECONTAMINATION PROCESS, THE VALVE SUCCEEDED TO REPROGRAM AND SUCCESSFULLY PASSED THE FLOW TEST. THEREFORE, THE PRODUCT WAS SENT TO THE EVALUATION SITE FOR INVESTIGATION. THE VALVE WAS ON POSITION 50 MMH2O WHEN RECEIVED. WATER WAS NOTED IN THE VALVE CASING, WHICH WAS PROBABLY RESIDUE OF WATER USED DURING THE DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURE. THE VALVE WAS TESTED FOR PROGRAMMING. THE VALVE SUCCEEDED TO REPROGRAM. THE VALVE WAS EXAMINED UNDER A MICROSCOPE AT APPROPRIATE MAGNIFICATION AND NOTHING ABNORMAL THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF FAILURE WAS NOTED. IT SEEMS THAT THE BIOLOGICAL DEBRIS, WHICH INTERFERED WITH THE ABILITY OF THE VALVE TO FLOW AND TO REPROGRAM SOFTENED AND WAS FLUSHED OUT DURING THE DECONTAMINATION PROCESS AND/OR DURING PRELIMINARY FLOW TEST. NO OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED BY THE CUSTOMER. NO PROBLEMS WERE NOTED DURING THE EXAMINATION OF THE DEVICE. ALL LOT HISTORY RECORDS ARE REVIEWED FOR COMPLETENESS PRIOR TO THE RELEASE. AT THAT TIME, IT WAS VERIFIED THAT THE PRODUCTS WERE CONFORMING PER REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. NO CORRECTIVE ACTION IS NEEDED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE EVALUATION. TRENDS WILL BE MONITORED FOR SIMILAR COMPLAINTS.

THE SERIAL NUMBER OF THE VALVE WAS FOUND, THE LOT NUMBER WAS CGMBJ8 AND THE PRODUCT CODE WAS FOUND TO BE 82-3162. THE VALVE WAS ON POSITION 70MMH2O WHEN RETURNED. THE VALVE WAS TESTED FOR PROGRAMMING PER. THE VALVE FAILED TO REPROGRAM. THEREFORE, THE VALVE WAS IRRIGATED WITH PURIFIED WATER, A SLIGHT AMOUNT OF DARK BIOLOGICAL DEBRIS WAS FLUSHED OUT. THEN THE VALVE WAS RETESTED FOR PROGRAMMING: THE VALVE SUCCEEDED TO REPROGRAM. THE VALVE WAS EXAMINED UNDER MICROSCOPE AT APPROPRIATE MAGNIFICATION AND IT WAS DISMANTLED. BIOLOGICAL DEBRIS WAS NOTED IN THE PROGRAMMING CONTROL MECHANISM. THE DEBRIS NOTED ON THE BASE PLATE AND ON THE LOWER SIDE OF THE CAM INTERFERED WITH THE ABILITY OF THE VALVE TO REPROGRAM. IT WAS THE APPARENT ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROGRAMMING TEST FAILURE. NO OTHER POTENTIAL CAUSES FOR THE PROGRAMMING PROBLEM WERE NOTED.

THIS HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED AT SEVERAL PROGRAMMING SESSIONS. THE PATIENT HAS BEEN HAVING INTERMITTENT SPASTICITY, BUT HE IS REPORTED TO BE A "COMPLEX PATIENT" WITH OTHER MEDICAL ISSUES, SO THEY KNOW THIS PROGRAMMING ERROR WAS NOT THE SOLE CONTRIBUTOR TO HIS SYMPTOMS. THE PATIENT'S PUMP WAS UPDATED AND THE PATIENT SENT HOME.

THE COMPLAINT OF A DEFIB COMM ERROR COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED OR VERIFIED IN THE DEVICE LOG AS OCCURRING HOWEVER, TWO ERROR CODES WERE IDENTIFIED DURING POWER UP OF THE DEVICE AND IN THE DEVICE LOG. ERROR CODES IDENTIFIED WERE DEFIB ERROR (A/D) AND MULTIPLE DEFIB CHARGE FAIL. THE CAUSE OF BOTH ERRORS WAS DUE TO PART OF THE CAPACITOR BANK NOT SUFFICIENTLY SOLDERED DURING THE ASSEMBLY PROCESS. UPON REPLACEMENT OF THE CAPACITOR BANK, THE DEVICE PERFORMS TO SPECIFICATIONS.
