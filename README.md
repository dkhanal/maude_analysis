# maude_sw_causes


This repository contains a program that implements natural-language-processing (NLP)-based machine learning techniques to classify the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) dataset published by the US Food and Drugs Administration.

More specifically, each record of narrative text that describes a medical device adverse event in the MAUDE dataset is classified in terms of its causality as either:

* Software-related event
* Non software-related event
